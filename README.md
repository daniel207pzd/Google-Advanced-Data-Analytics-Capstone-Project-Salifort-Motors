This is a capstone project that I have completed as part of the [Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-advanced-data-analytics). This certificate builds on data analytics skills and experience to take careers to the next level. It is designed for graduates of the [Google Data Analytics Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) or people with equivalent data analytics experience. This course enables learners to expand their knowledge through practical, hands-on projects that feature Jupyter Notebook, Python, and Tableau. Course participants can learn the following:

- Explore the roles of data professionals within an organization 
- Create data visualizations and apply statistical methods to investigate data
- Build regression and machine learning models to analyze and interpret data
- Communicate insights from data analysis to stakeholders

## Background

### About the Company
Salifort Motors is a fictional French-based alternative energy vehicle manufacturer. Its global workforce of over 100,000 employees research, design, construct, validate, and distribute electric, solar, algae, and hydrogen-based vehicles. Salifortâ€™s end-to-end vertical integration model has made it a global leader at the intersection of alternative energy and automobiles.

### Business Case
As a data specialist working for Salifort Motors, I have received the results of a recent employee survey. The senior leadership team has tasked me with analysing the data to come up with ideas for how to increase employee retention. To help with this, they would like me to design a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company based on their department, number of projects, average monthly hours, and any other data points you deem helpful. 

### Deliverable Value
For this deliverable, I am asked to choose a method to approach this data challenge based on my prior coursework. Select either a regression model or a tree-based machine learning model to predict whether an employee will leave the company.
